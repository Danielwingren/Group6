To start a poem like this
Could either be a hit or miss
I wonder how will it evolve?
Will there maybe be a riddle to solve?
Only next person know
I just hope my part didnt blow...

There will be no riddle
Only some text in the middle
Now I wonder how it will end 
What will the next person send?

Stopâ€”This poem will continue no further
Or i will be forced to commit a murder
Poems are not allowed here
Just who do you think you are, William Shakespeare?
Now move along you dirty old creep
If you would like your life to keep
